# Neural Network Task

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for a specific machine learning task using a Jupyter notebook. The notebook guides you through the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Loading and preparing the dataset for training, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

2. Model Building: Constructing a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras. This includes defining the architecture, choosing the activation functions, and setting up the optimizer and loss functions.

3. Model Training: Training the neural network model on the prepared dataset. This involves feeding the data into the model, adjusting weights through backpropagation, and monitoring the training process using metrics such as accuracy and loss.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model on the test set. This includes generating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to understand how well the model performs.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to optimize the model's performance.

6. Visualization: Visualizing the results of the training process, including plotting the training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs, and visualizing the model's predictions versus the actual values.
